The following repository has the control system designed for control of a quad-rotor based on the paper PID vs LQ Control Techniques Applied to an Indoor Micro Quadrotor by S. Bouabdallah, et all.

The objective is to develop an LQG regulator for the linear dynamic model propossed. Futher works will include sub-optimal control through the use of a pre-defined state trajectory and time-varying regulator design.
